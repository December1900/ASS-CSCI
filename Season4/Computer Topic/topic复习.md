## Challenges for Emerging Technology NoC
### Energy efficient NoC with high data throughput capability
The pursuit of high-efficiency NoC with high throughput is the main reason for the exploration of emerging technology NoC. From this perspective, the hybrid approach is a viable solution. For example, the combination of conventional NoC and optical NoC is very interesting. Conventional NoC can handle local and repeated transactions, while ONoC can handle remote transactions or transactions with higher throughput. In addition, the new substrate material can provide higher yields while having a reasonable cost of power consumption.

## The analytical engine
The Analytical Engine was a proposed mechanical general-purpose computer designed by English mathematician and computer pioneer Charles Babbage.

The Analytical Engine has many essential features found in the modern digital computer. 

+ It had an internal repertoire of the four arithmetical functions and could perform direct multiplication and division. 
+ It was also capable of functions for which we have modern names: conditional branching, looping, microprogramming, parallel processing, iteration, latching, polling, and pulse-shaping, amongst others.
+ It had a variety of outputs including hardcopy printout, punched cards, graph plotting and the automatic production of stereotypes.


## Conflict of interest
A conflict of interest occurs when there is a divergence between an dindividual's private interests and his or her professional obligatioins to the University such that an independent observer might reasonably question whether the individual's professinaol actions or decisions are detemined by considerations of personal gain, financial or otherwise.
