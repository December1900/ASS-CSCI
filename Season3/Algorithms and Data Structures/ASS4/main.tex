\section{Problem 1}
\subsection{Question A}
We can choose counting sort which runs in O(n) time and it is a stable sorting algorithm. 

\subsection{Question B}
We can execute Quicksort-Partition one pass around around the pivot (x=0).
If it is a Lomuto partition, it will place all 0 elements on the left and all 1 elements on the right.
This will also sort the array.
After that, it is in place and has a O(n) running time.

Here is the pseudocode:
\begin{lstlisting}
i = 0
for j = 1 to n
if A[j] <= 0
then i = i + 1
swap(A[i], A[j])
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Question C}
We can choose insertion sort which is an in place sorting algorithm and is also stable.
We can consider the situation ($A[i] = A[j]$ and $i < j$).
Since i < j, the priority $A[i]$  will be added to the sorted array $A[1\cdots i-1]$ by moving in the correct position.
